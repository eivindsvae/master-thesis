Algorithm to generate Julia sets and project them onto the unit sphere. The algorithm then integrate over the sphere to define a quantum state, and calculates the entanglement entropy in such a system for a given subsystem size. Given with an example of how to run it.

There is also a slightly modified version, which does the same, for Cantor sets.
